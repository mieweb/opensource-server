# Welcome to MIE Opensource Proxmox Cluster

Welcome to the documentation for the **Opensource Proxmox Cluster** at MIE (Medical Informatics Engineering). This platform provides developers and researchers with access to virtualized infrastructure for building, testing, and deploying applications in a collaborative opensource environment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To begin using the MIE Opensource Proxmox Cluster, you'll need:

### Prerequisites

- **Valid Proxmox Account**: You must have an active PVE account at <ProxmoxUrl><ProxmoxUrl /></ProxmoxUrl>
- Basic understanding of virtualization concepts
- SSH client for remote access to containers

:::tip Access Required
If you don't have an account yet, please contact the MIE team to request access to the opensource Proxmox cluster.
:::

:::important Important
When logging into <ProxmoxUrl><ProxmoxUrl /></ProxmoxUrl>, make sure you are logging in with the PVE Realm.

## What You Can Do

Our documentation covers everything you need to work with the cluster:

### New to Proxmox?
**[Introduction to Proxmox →](/docs/proxmox-introduction)**

Learn the fundamentals of Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE), understand the interface, and discover how virtualization works in our cluster environment.

### Ready to Build?
**[Create Your First Container →](/docs/creating-containers/basic-containers/command-line)**

Step-by-step guide to creating and configuring your own Linux container (LXC) from scratch. Perfect for hosting applications, development environments, or testing new software.

### Want to Deploy Applications Automatically?
**[Advanced Container Deployment →](/docs/creating-containers/advanced-containers/deploying-containers-overview)**

Learn how to automatically deploy your applications during container creation, with support for single and multi-component applications.

### Automate Your Deployments with GitHub
**[Proxmox Launchpad Integration →](/docs/proxmox-launchpad/what-is-proxmox-launchpad)**

Connect your GitHub repositories to automatically deploy your projects to the cluster using our custom GitHub Actions workflow. Set up CI/CD pipelines that build and deploy directly to your Proxmox containers.

### Develop with VSCode
**[VSCode Remote Development →](/docs/vscode-setup)**

Connect VSCode directly to your containers for seamless remote development with full IDE capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Free Opensource Infrastructure**: Access to enterprise-grade virtualization at no cost
- **Flexible Container Support**: Run both lightweight and resource-intensive containers (LXC)
- **Automated Deployments**: Integrate with GitHub Actions for seamless CI/CD
- **Collaborative Environment**: Share resources and collaborate with other developers
- **Scalable Resources**: CPU, memory, and storage will be allocated based on your project needs

## Getting Access

1. **Login to Proxmox**: Navigate to <ProxmoxUrl><ProxmoxUrl /></ProxmoxUrl>
2. **Use your credentials**: Login with your provided username and password and **select the PVE Realm**.
3. **Explore the interface**: Familiarize yourself with the Proxmox web interface
4. **Start building**: Create your first container
