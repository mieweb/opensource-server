# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the **Opensource Proxmox Cluster** at MIE (Medical Informatics Engineering). This platform provides access to virtualized infrastructure for building, testing, and deploying applications in a collaborative opensource environment.

## Key Features

- **Free Opensource Infrastructure**: Access to enterprise-grade virtualization at no cost
- **Flexible Container Support**: Run both lightweight and resource-intensive containers (LXC)
- **Automated Deployments**: Integrate with GitHub Actions for seamless CI/CD
- **Collaborative Environment**: Share resources and collaborate with others
- **Scalable Resources**: CPU, memory, and storage allocated based on project needs
